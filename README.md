# ipw4
Easily remember IPs by mapping words to octets. Inspired by what3words.

You can find the mapping list in mapping.json. There is a DNS service at ipw4.com that resolves these names to IPs, for example:

```mid.nil.nil.abs.ipw4.com``` resolves to `127.0.0.1`

## Examples
```
mid.nil.nil.abs.ipw4.com -> 127.0.0.1
abs.abs.abs.abs.ipw4.com -> 1.1.1.1
```
